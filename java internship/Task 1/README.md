# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This is a simple Java program where the user tries to guess a random number within a specified range.

## How to Play

1. Run the program using a Java compiler or IDE.
2. You will be prompted to guess a random number between a specified lower and upper bound.
3. You have a limited number of attempts (default is 10) to guess the correct number.
4. After each guess, the program will provide feedback:
   - If your guess is correct, you win the round and your score increases.
   - If your guess is too low, you'll be prompted to try again.
   - If your guess is too high, you'll also be prompted to try again.
5. If you run out of attempts without guessing the correct number, the game will reveal the target number.
6. After each round, you can choose to play again or exit.

# Currency Converter

Welcome to the Currency Converter program. This Java application allows you to convert an amount from USD to either EUR or GBP, using predefined exchange rates.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ (optional, but recommended)

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project from the [repository](https://github.com/yourusername/yourcurrencyconverter).
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE if you have one.
3. Run the `CurrencyConverter.java` file, which contains the main program.

Alternatively, you can compile and run the program using the command line:

```shell
$ javac CurrencyConverter.java
$ java CurrencyConverter
Usage
When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter an amount in USD.
Next, you'll be asked to choose the target currency:
Enter 1 for EUR (Euros).
Enter 2 for GBP (British Pounds).
The program will display the equivalent amount in the chosen currency.
Here's an example:
Welcome to the Currency Converter!
Enter the amount in USD: 100
Choose the target currency:
1. EUR
2. GBP
Enter the number for your choice: 1
100.0 USD is equivalent to 85.0 EUR
Customization
You can customize this program by modifying the exchange rates in the CurrencyConverter.java file to reflect the most up-to-date rates.
// Define exchange rates (simplified)
final double USD_TO_EUR_RATE = 0.85;
final double USD_TO_GBP_RATE = 0.73;
